These first three tables are a bold and equally stellar introduction to Star Wars Pinball, and they'll keep you more than busy until Zen Studios drops the next batch. <\/p>\n<p>Game Informer - 8.5\/10 <br \/>You don't need to be a Star Wars fan to recognize the creativity Zen has brought to the new tables. The company continues to include more fantasy elements in its designs. <\/p>\n<p>CNET - 8.9\/10<br \/>The best thing about Star Wars Pinball is its jaw-dropping graphics. The many targets, ramps, rollovers, and kickers that make up its pinball course are all polished with incredible detail. Even the pinball itself is stunning, with its metallic surface realistically reflecting the ambient lights as it spins across the table. And the choreographed flashing of all these table elements really make you feel as though Zen Studios pulled out all the stops when making this game.<\/p>\n<p>Penny Arcade Report (Ben Kuchera) <br \/>If you\u2019re a fan of pinball, Star Wars, or fun things, this is pretty much a must-purchase.<\/p>\n<p><br \/>### Be sure to visit us at www.zenpinball.com.

This weekend, January 24th-26th, we invite you to compete in the final round of the Mobile Gaming Championship! Anyone can compete, but the final 18 participants will battle for the title of \u201CWorld\u2019s Best Mobile Gamer.\u201D Stars Wars™ Pinball: Balance of the Force on Android will be the final test for competitors in the Mobile Gaming Championship, and the final 18 qualifiers will compete for rewards including a PS4, Xbox One and Google Glass. To compete, just download Star Wars Pinball on Android if you haven\u2019t already and post a score during the weekend of January 24th-26th. The winner of the final round will earn the mother of all bragging rights: their name will be recorded in the Guinness World Records 2014 Gamer\u2019s Edition! Tune into the Kiip MGC Twitch channel to watch the best of the best compete! Good luck and May the Force be with you! Set in a galaxy far, far away, Star Wars Pinball lets you interact with the most iconic characters, and relive the greatest moments of the Star Wars universe in 3 Star Wars-themed tables: Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and Boba Fett. Choose to support the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance with your high scores as the Star Wars Pinball community fights for the Balance of the Force! The initial Star Wars Pinball download comes with the Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back table. Other Star Wars Pinball tables can be purchased as in-app purchases. Additional Star Wars Pinball tables are coming soon! May the Force be with you! What the Press Are Saying: GamesRadar As a complete package, Star Wars Pinball delivers the kind of arcade experience that makes you crave just one more game, constantly chasing to surpass your own score for the sheer satisfaction of it. Desctructoid - 9.5\/10 Each table is chock full of beautiful art, character cameos, and tracks pulled straight from the films' soundtracks. These first three tables are a bold and equally stellar introduction to Star Wars Pinball, and they'll keep you more than busy until Zen Studios drops the next batch. Game Informer - 8.5\/10 You don't need to be a Star Wars fan to recognize the creativity Zen has brought to the new tables. The company continues to include more fantasy elements in its designs. CNET - 8.9\/10 The best thing about Star Wars Pinball is its jaw-dropping graphics. The many targets, ramps, rollovers, and kickers that make up its pinball course are all polished with incredible detail. Even the pinball itself is stunning, with its metallic surface realistically reflecting the ambient lights as it spins across the table. And the choreographed flashing of all these table elements really make you feel as though Zen Studios pulled out all the stops when making this game. Penny Arcade Report (Ben Kuchera) If you\u2019re a fan of pinball, Star Wars, or fun things, this is pretty much a must-purchase. ### Be sure to visit us at www.zenpinball.com.
