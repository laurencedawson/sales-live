The app is a perfect choice when it comes to correcting and enhancing photos from all possible angles. <\/p>\n<p>* Making tonal and color adjustments globally and locally * <br \/>Improve the general look of your photos by performing both global and local tonal and color corrections in them. With a few taps and swipes only, turn your images into vivid and vibrant works of art. <\/p>\n<p>* Retouching photos with ultimate ease * <br \/>Remove unwanted content from your photos in a tap. Mobile image retouching has never been so fast and easy. <\/p>\n<p>* Moving objects from photo to photo * <br \/>Is it possible to move any object within a single photo or to another image in just a few taps? The answer is yes when it comes to the Move Me tool. With it, you can do the impossible \u2013 move objects in photos to the locations they would never move to in real life. <\/p>\n<p>* Applying filters to images partially * <br \/>With the Handy Photo\u2019s powerful photo filters, which include Black and White, Bleach Bypass, Color Standout, Cross Process, Dramatic, Duotone, Fog, Glow, Golden, HDR, Halftone, Ink, Lomo, Old Photo, Polarization, Polaroid, Sepia, Sketch, Smart Contrast, Tilt-Shift, Tiny Planet, Vignette, and Vintage, you can add whatever artistic effects wanted to your images. The filters are all adjustable and, thanks to the partial application feature, can be easily combined within photos. <\/p>\n<p>* Adding textures to photos partially * <br \/>Apply the Handy Photo\u2019s terrific textures to your images to make them truly pop. You can select from the following categories of textures: Abstract, Cloth, Clouds, Frost and Ice, Grunge, Paper, Water, and Wood. All the textures can be adjusted to taste and applied to photos partially. <\/p>\n<p>* Uncropping photos in a unique way * <br \/>The tool is called Magic not accidentally. It allows uniquely uncropping photos. No other app can do that.
