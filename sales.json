(originally $7.99, now only $2.99) Join 750,000+ runners in an epic adventure! You tie your shoes, put on your headphones, take your first steps outside. You\u2019ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they\u2019re everywhere. Zombies. There\u2019s only one thing you can do: Run! \n\nZombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. We deliver the story straight to your headphones through orders and voice recordings - and when you get back home, you use the supplies you\u2019ve collected while running to build and grow your base. \n\nBBC NEWS - \u201CThe only way to save yourself is to run for real.\u201D WIRED - \u201CIn the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.\u201D LIFEHACKER - \u201CA really cool way to get outside and exercise.\u201D CNN - \u201CTurns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.\u201D NPR - \"It gets you moving!\" TIME.COM - \"Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.\" \n\nWHAT PLAYERS SAY: \u201CEvaded all zombie mobs :-) One of my best sprints ever; this app works!\u201D \u201CThis game will make you sweat. Perfect junction between game design and run tracker.\u201D \u201CJust tried @zombiesrungame and for the first time in my life I feel truly alive.\u201D \n\nWALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE Zombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail.\n\nYOU ARE RUNNER 5 Hundreds of lives are counting on you. You've got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse? \n\nA WORLD OF STORIES You become the hero in an epic story of humanity\u2019s struggle for survival where your running *really* matters - and there\u2019s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well... This app includes all 33 missions from Season 1 as well as the first 7 missions from Season 2; and there'll be a further 60+ Season 2 missions released weekly and available for purchase! \n\nYOUR OWN MIX Choose your own custom playlists before you start running: the story unfolds in between your tracks through a series of dynamic radio messages and voice recordings. \n\nINTERVAL TRAINING - WITH ZOMBIES With our optional \u2018Zombie Chases\u2019 mode, you\u2019ll need to increase your speed and work up a sweat if you hear zombies on your tail. That\u2019s right - we\u2019ve made interval training *fun*! \n\nVIEW YOUR RUNS ONLINE WITH ZOMBIELINK Register with our free ZombieLink service to view and share your runs online, complete with maps and full run history. Plus you can sync your runs with Runkeeper, export them as GPX files, and share them with friends!\n\nKEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE You automatically collect items like medicine, batteries, and ammo while running - but when you're back home, who needs them more: the soldiers or the doctors? Which buildings need extra defenses? It\u2019s up to you.\n\nNOTES - Version 2.0 comes with 30 missions - Requires Android 4.0 or above - Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. \n\nINFORMATION ABOUT UPGRADING FROM VERSION 1.0 All Season 1 story missions are still included in ZR2 for free, along with mission progress and run logs. To change between seasons, simply visit the Missions screen and tap the \"Season 1\" tab at the top-left of the screen. This will display a menu that lets you switch to Season 2.\n\nThe Season 1 base has been upgraded to a new, more advanced base that fits in with the Season 2 story. You can still view your old base on ZombieLink.
