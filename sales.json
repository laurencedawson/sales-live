There is no need to take a photo or press a button. Scan will automatically recognize any code your camera is pointing at.<\/p>\n<p>When scanning a QR code, if the code contains a website URL, you will automatically be taken to the site. If the code just contains text, you'll immediately see it. For other formats such as phone numbers, email addresses, or contact info, you will be prompted to take the appropriate action.<\/p>\n<p>PRODUCT BARCODES<\/p>\n<p>Scan recognizes all of the popular barcode types (UPC, EAN, and ISBN) and shows you pricing, reviews, and more about any products you scan.

PRODUCT BARCODES Scan recognizes all of the popular barcode types (UPC, EAN, and ISBN) and shows you pricing, reviews, and more about any products you scan.
