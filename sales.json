The game features anarchic drive-wherever-you-like gameplay and over-the-top surreal comedy violence. It\u2019s the racing game where racing is for wimps. Now the same Mac & PC classic that was BANNED AROUND THE WORLD is back and available on Android phones and tablets! Carmageddon features real-world environments that have been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level is sprinkled generously with power-ups that have a vast variety of mad effects, adding a whole extra level of craziness to the proceedings. In every event you have the option to \u201Cplay it your way\u201D\u2026 Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps. Oh and watch out \u2013 the cops in their super-tough armoured patrol vehicles are lurking, and if they catch you being bad they\u2019ll be down on you like several tons of cold pork! FEATURES \u2022 28 dangerously deranged Opponents \u2022 11 wildly exhilarating Environments \u2022 Career Mode featuring 36 satisfyingly violent Levels \u2022 Race and Wreck opponents to unlock 30 playable cars! \u2022 Multiple control methods: digital, analogue (mix \u2018n\u2019 match), tilt \u2022 Edit your control layout in game to your preferences \u2022 Comprehensive Action Replay System \u2022 Environment maps and other special effects \u2022 Enhanced pre-lit environments \u2022 Buckets of gibs \u2022 Tons of laughs Plus the opportunity to make in app purchases to unlock ALL the cars (apart from the secret one) and ALL the races!
