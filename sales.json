You do not need to have played any previous Gamebook Adventures titles in order to play this.<\/p>\n<p>Cruelly taken from your homeland of Orlandes, you find yourself in a far off land at the mercy of a gladiatorial arena. Somehow trying to find a way to escape overseas, can you also unravel a potentially dangerous mystery that puts two nations on the brink of war?<\/p>\n<p>&quot;Slaves of Rema is epic in scope, but doesn't lose sight of the plight of your character. It brings the twists and turns at a satisfying pace, and all of this is supported by the wonderful art we have come to expect from Tin Man Games.&quot; - Touch Gaming Magazine<\/p>\n<p>&quot;I can't help but feel a certain nostalgia for these four interactive books. Without noticing it, I got sucked into the first one over the Christmas holiday and went back to the previous pages and cheat reading different plots.&quot; - App Freak<\/p>\n<p>\u2028\u2028What is a Gamebook Adventure?<\/p>\n<p>Gamebook Adventures is brought together through the efforts of passionate and avid gamebook enthusiasts. If you are familiar with the Choose You Own Adventure, Fighting Fantasy, Sorcery, Lone Wolf or Grail Quest series then Gamebook Adventures will really appeal to you. Our aim is to give those nostalgic readers of old something new and fresh, and bring a new exciting experience to those unfamiliar with gamebooks. If you enjoy fantasy RPGs or adventure games then this is for you!<\/p>\n<p>At their core, all of our gamebooks are compelling adventure stories where you get to choose how the adventure unfolds. Every section of the narrative concludes with choices that you have to make. The choices you make will alter the story, taking you down new paths and giving you new choices.<\/p>\n<p>Occasionally you will be presented with a situation that needs to be resolved with some dice rolling. The gamebook engine lets you throw 3D physics based dice that roll and bounce as if you were tossing them on a tabletop. Roll the dice to resolve combat by pitting your character against a myriad of enemies. Roll the dice to see if you were able to leap the gaping chasm, or pick the shopkeep\u2019s pockets. Roll the dice to see if you won a bet, or caught the plague!<\/p>\n<p>Did you take a wrong turn? Or make some bad dice rolls?

Third in the series of critically acclaimed interactive fantasy gamebooks in which you, the reader, control the direction of the story! You do not need to have played any previous Gamebook Adventures titles in order to play this. Cruelly taken from your homeland of Orlandes, you find yourself in a far off land at the mercy of a gladiatorial arena. Somehow trying to find a way to escape overseas, can you also unravel a potentially dangerous mystery that puts two nations on the brink of war? \"Slaves of Rema is epic in scope, but doesn't lose sight of the plight of your character. It brings the twists and turns at a satisfying pace, and all of this is supported by the wonderful art we have come to expect from Tin Man Games.\" - Touch Gaming Magazine \"I can't help but feel a certain nostalgia for these four interactive books. Without noticing it, I got sucked into the first one over the Christmas holiday and went back to the previous pages and cheat reading different plots.\" - App Freak \u2028\u2028What is a Gamebook Adventure?

Occasionally you will be presented with a situation that needs to be resolved with some dice rolling. The gamebook engine lets you throw 3D physics based dice that roll and bounce as if you were tossing them on a tabletop.
