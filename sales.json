The game features anarchic drive-wherever-you-like gameplay and over-the-top surreal comedy violence. It\u2019s the racing game where racing is for wimps. Now the same Mac & PC classic that was BANNED AROUND THE WORLD is back and available on Android phones and tablets! Carmageddon features real-world environments that have been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level is sprinkled generously with power-ups that have a vast variety of mad effects, adding a whole extra level of craziness to the proceedings. In every event you have the option to \u201Cplay it your way\u201D\u2026 Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps.
