When you're done, you can replay your touch events as easily.

Thus, always monitor your device during replay! Replay automatically stops if you're touching the screen, pressing the power button or on a phone call.

Celebrate the Holidays every time you use your device, in true 3-D! Gather the family together in a cozy den, in front of a warm crackling fireplace. Your own picture on the mantel is surrounded by twinkling Christmas lights, and stockings with your names grace the fireplace. Enjoy a Christmas tree with customizable lights, gifts, and tree topper. Eagerly await Santa's visit with a calendar that counts down the days until Christmas, and leave cookies and a note for Santa Claus. Gaze out the frost-covered window at a picturesque Winter scene while snow gently falls. Customize every part of the scene, including your own photograph on the fireplace, your text on the stockings and the message for Santa. Choose the color of lights, customize the ornaments, gifts and ribbons, snowflakes, garland, tree topper, and more! You can also show or hide the items in the scene to celebrate the wonders of Christmas in a way that means the most to you. Optional add-on packs are available for purchase, so you can choose the features most meaningful to you. A classic rendition of a timeless outdoor Christmas painting in 3-D, the Outdoor Pack features a brand-new, fully animated, customizable, and interactive scene of the outside of the house rendered in stunning detail.
