Start as a tiny aquatic being, and climb the evolutionary ladder until you become a huge, magnificent creature. Explore the abyss in search of food. Attack other species whenever you run out of other food sources. Outsmart competing Sparkles and eat more micro-elements than them in the new competitive mode. Enjoy the surreal visuals and relaxing soundtrack.<br \/>Can you grow the biggest Sparkle in the world?<\/p>\n<p>Subtle, captivating, addictive. We give you control over your Sparkle's development and well-being and you have one goal - to evolve. Whilst exploring the Sparkle Void, you find various nutritious elements to eat. Sometimes you will even have to fight for food with other species. You become what you eat - you get to choose whether your sparkle becomes a fast and aggressive carnivore, a sluggish but fast-eating herbivore, or an omnivore, whose features lie somewhere in between. Insight to your Sparkle's DNA strand will give you information about the progress and will help you plan which micro-elements you want to focus on eating next. You will also get to fight giant bosses from time to time.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no rush to keep the game in full swing at all times. You may as well just relax, play the game on a slow pace, explore the sparkle void, consume nutritional elements, enjoy simple and surreal surrounding and listen to the ambient music soundtrack. The choice is all yours.<\/p>\n<p>- Three different ways to evolve.
