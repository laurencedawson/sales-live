Over 100,000 golfers worldwide, including Major Championship winners on the PGA Tour, have improved their games by using Tour Tempo. <\/p>\n<p>&quot;It will be the best thing that you will ever do for your game.&quot; - Pat Dempsey, 2002 RE\/MAX World Long Drive Sr. Champion <\/p>\n<p>&quot;The Unified Theory of Tempo&quot; - Golf Digest <\/p>\n<p>&quot;No one has ever come up with a way to teach Tempo until now.&quot; - Travel + Leisure Golf <\/p>\n<p>&quot;The Swing Secret no one has ever told you&quot; - Golf for Women Magazine <\/p>\n<p>Based on the international best selling golf book, Tour Tempo. The book outlines and explains the discovery of a specific mathematical ratio regarding the elapsed time of the backswing and the elapsed time of the downswing of the Tour Pros. The Tour Tempo System is simple and easy to learn. All you do is react to three scientifically spaced musical notes. These musical notes alert you to start your takeaway, start your downswing, and then the third note lines you up with impact. It\u2019s just that easy - you literally download the App, turn it on, grab a club and start swinging to the Tempo of the Tour Pros. <\/p>\n<p>TOUR TEMPO LONG GAME TONES <br \/>The Tones will teach you how to swing with the tempo ratio exhibited by the Tour Pros. We measured the time of their backswings and downswings by counting how many frames of video each part took. The magic ratio on full swings turned out to be three parts backswing to one part downswing. Tones are provided for each of the following frame ratios of Tour Tempo - 18\/6, 21\/7, 24\/8, and 27\/9. The Tour Tempo Tones have a clear purpose. They establish the intrinsic tempo of the golf swing in your subconscious mind. Once this is accomplished, you will not have to think about tempo while playing. This is what the Tour Pros have already done. You are about to acquire that same ability. <\/p>\n<p>TOUR TEMPO SHORT GAME TONES <br \/>The Total Game App also contains the new Tour Tempo Short Game Tones of 14\/7, 16\/8, 18\/9, and 20\/10. After the publication of Tour Tempo, John Novosel studied the Short Game swings of the top touring pros, and discovered that virtually all of them employ a 2 to 1 swing ratio on or around the greens - a different Tempo than the 3 to 1 ratio of the Long Game. This is another reason why the game of Golf is so hard to master. <\/p>\n<p>TOUR TEMPO TRACKS (21\/7, 24\/8, &amp; 27\/9) <br \/>The Tour Tempo Tracks are an easy way to integrate Tour Tempo into your daily routine.

There is no need to take a photo or press a button. Scan will automatically recognize any code your camera is pointing at.<\/p>\n<p>When scanning a QR code, if the code contains a website URL, you will automatically be taken to the site. If the code just contains text, you'll immediately see it. For other formats such as phone numbers, email addresses, or contact info, you will be prompted to take the appropriate action.<\/p>\n<p>PRODUCT BARCODES<\/p>\n<p>Scan recognizes all of the popular barcode types (UPC, EAN, and ISBN) and shows you pricing, reviews, and more about any products you scan. Barcode scanning requires a newer device in order to work reliably. Cameras on older devices do not provide the resolution or focus required for barcode scanning.<\/p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL FEATURES<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 View a history list and map of all of your past scans<br \/>\u2022 Sync your scan history across the web and all of your devices<br \/>\u2022 Toggle your front or rear camera for scanning<br \/>\u2022 Set a default browser to open websites in<br \/>\u2022 Scan pictures of QR codes and barcodes from your camera roll<br \/>\u2022 A switch to turn on your device\u2019s light (if it has one) for scanning in low-light circumstances<\/p>\n<p>DEDICATED TO PERFECTION<\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to make our app the best scanning app in the store. We can\u2019t do this without you. We are dedicated to your satisfaction and need to hear feedback from you.

(over 50% off!) ABOUT SCAN Scan is the fastest and most user-friendly QR reader and barcode scanner available. If your Android came with a built-in scanner, this would be it. Here is what our reviewers are saying: \u201CQuick and very reliable. I\u2019d give it six stars if it were possible.\u201D \u201CNo ads, beautiful design, and even caught blurry QR codes I didn\u2019t expect it to scan\u201D \u201CI\u2019ve saved over $80 by scanning products in the store and finding them cheaper online\u201D HOW THE APP WORKS To scan a QR code or barcode simply open the app, point the camera at the code, and you\u2019re done! There is no need to take a photo or press a button. Scan will automatically recognize any code your camera is pointing at. When scanning a QR code, if the code contains a website URL, you will automatically be taken to the site. If the code just contains text, you'll immediately see it. For other formats such as phone numbers, email addresses, or contact info, you will be prompted to take the appropriate action. PRODUCT BARCODES Scan recognizes all of the popular barcode types (UPC, EAN, and ISBN) and shows you pricing, reviews, and more about any products you scan. Barcode scanning requires a newer device in order to work reliably. Cameras on older devices do not provide the resolution or focus required for barcode scanning. ADDITIONAL FEATURES \u2022 View a history list and map of all of your past scans \u2022 Sync your scan history across the web and all of your devices \u2022 Toggle your front or rear camera for scanning \u2022 Set a default browser to open websites in \u2022 Scan pictures of QR codes and barcodes from your camera roll \u2022 A switch to turn on your device\u2019s light (if it has one) for scanning in low-light circumstances DEDICATED TO PERFECTION Our goal is to make our app the best scanning app in the store. We can\u2019t do this without you. We are dedicated to your satisfaction and need to hear feedback from you. If you have an issue with Scan, please do not write a review of the app saying \"it didn't work.\" This does not help us make things better for you. Instead, please contact us at support@scan.me or on Twitter @scan and we'll do our best to help. REQUIREMENTS In order to use Scan, your device must have a built-in camera. When scanning codes that redirect to online content, such as websites, you will need Internet connectivity. MAKE YOUR OWN QR CODES ON SCAN.ME Want to make your own QR codes for others to scan? Visit our site at http:\/\/scan.me to create and manage your own QR codes for free. Update: We recently released a new Wi-Fi QR code type on our site. These new Wi-Fi QR codes allow visitors to your home or business scan a QR code to get easy access to your wireless network.","contentRating":"","rating":"4.3"},{"icon":"https:\/\/lh4.ggpht.com\/E_NdBNwdVOmEVg6XcthqTTNFiDuHVJtlLntg4twsdHXkD3ganNLVAbGyyealYJIzpII=w300","descriptionRaw":"Train like an athlete to look like an athlete \n<br \/>Freeletics offers high-intensity workouts to \n<br \/>get an athletic body simply by using your \n<br \/>bodyweight - no machines, no weights! \n<br \/>Click on \u201E...More\u201C to find out why you should download the Freeletics app right now! \n<p>★★ The PRO version contains all the Freeletics workouts ★★<\/p>\n<p>APP FEATURES <br \/>✓ High-intensity workouts with video tutorials <br \/>✓ Track your time for every workout with the Timer <br \/>✓ Follow your friends and compete with them <br \/>✓ Compare your time with others on the leaderboard <br \/>✓ Share your success with friends <\/p>\n<p>Download the app right now, start a Freeletics workout, and compare your time with your friends and athletes around the world. <\/p>\n<p>FOR EVERYONE - FROM ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS TO TOP ATHLETES <br \/>✓ No need to worry if you can\u2019t do pullups or pushups.
